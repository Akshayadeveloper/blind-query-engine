# blind-query-engine
<b>Focus: </b>Running computations (aggregations, ML inference) directly on encrypted data.

<b>Core Problem Solved: </b>

Enables companies to run complex queries or statistical analysis over sensitive, distributed datasets without ever decrypting the data. This solves the "Zero-Trust Computation" problem and ensures data privacy in multi-party or cloud environments by leveraging Homomorphic Encryption principles.

<b>The Solution Mechanism (Python): </b>

A simplified implementation demonstrating the principle of operating on encrypted data. Note: True Homomorphic Encryption requires a complex library (like Microsoft SEAL), but this core demonstrates the concept of the Encrypted Value class and its overloaded operations.
